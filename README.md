## Overview
In this project, I was tasked with visualizing earthquake data. This project pulls from an api that updates consistantly. I marked the earthquake data by differing the markers in size and color. The size of the marker communicated the magnitude of the earthquake, while the color communicated the depth of the earthquake.
