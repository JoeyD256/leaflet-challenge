# leaflet-challenge

For this challenge, I heavely relied on the class recordings to guide me. I struggled with creating the legend, and I had issues with working geoJson into my code. 

But I was able to get the essentials and believe I could get a decent score.

I plan on coming back to this to fully complete it whether I get a good grade or not, and I also intend on completing the optional second part of the challenge
